## Initial setup

First start with `npm i` to install all necessary dependancies

Certain files have been added to .gitignore

.env files will need to be added after initial clone/fork

    .env.test
    .env.development

Example of what these files should contain:

    PGDATABASE=INSERT_DATABASE_NAME_HERE
